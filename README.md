Testing is essential to guarantee the reliability, stability and quality of an application. They enable errors to be detected and corrected as early as the development phase, thus reducing costs and risks in production. 

* Detect errors early → Avoid bugs in production.
* Ensure maintainability → Allow modifications without breaking existing code.
* Guarantee compliance → Verify that the software meets requirements.
* Facilitate collaboration → Help teams understand and validate code.
